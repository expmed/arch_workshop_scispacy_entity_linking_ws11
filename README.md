## Options to Follow Along with the Hands On Module

### *Option 1.* Link to Notebook in Google Colab *(preferred)*:
1. Google Colab Link to Notebook: [Google Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/expmed/arch_workshop_scispacy_entity_linking_ws11/blob/main/workshop_notebook.ipynb)

### *Option 2.* Minimal Local Environment Instructions *(for Workshop Attendees who Want to Run Locally)* 

These steps will help you install Python, set up a Conda environment, fetch the Synthea generator, and run the workshop notebooks locally.

ðŸ“¦ Step 1: Install Anaconda (Recommended)
Anaconda includes Python, Jupyter, and package management tools in one.

Download and install Anaconda for your operating system:

[Windows / macOS / Linux](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

After installing, open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or a terminal (Mac/Linux).

ðŸ“‚ Step 2: Clone the Workshop Repository
If you're using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/expmed/arch_workshop_scispacy_entity_linking_ws11.git
cd arch_workshop_scispacy_entity_linking_ws11
```
Or, download the ZIP from the provided link and extract it. Then navigate into the folder:

```bash
cd arch_workshop_scispacy_entity_linking_ws11
```
ðŸ§ª Step 3: Create and Activate the Conda Environment
This installs all required Python packages for the notebooks.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate environment  # replace with your env name if different
```

ðŸ““ Step 4: Launch the Workshop Jupyter Notebook
From within your activated Conda environment and workshop directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Your browser will open automatically. Navigate to the .ipynb files for hands-on exercises.
